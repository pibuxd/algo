## Testing

+ ***pattern.cpp*** - the solution that is checked if it is correct
+ ***generator.cpp*** - creates random input for task
+ ***brute.cpp*** - the brute solution which checks if the pattern is correct
+ ***tester.sh*** - a bash script that manages the pattern testing process
+ ***tester-portable.sh*** - very simple bash script that manages the pattern testing process
