My competitive programming solutions, mainly from Polish Olympiad in Informatics and CODEFORCES. May be wrong or incomplete especially in POI.
This repository is used by me as a diary and can be used as a ready-made solution. I also hope not to submit it to the cp platform mindlessly just for flex...

+ ***brute.cpp*** - a brute-force solution whose output is compared to the pattern's output
+ ***tester.sh*** - script that manages the testing process
+ ***tester-portable.sh*** - simple and portable version of `tester.sh`
+ ***tester-pack.sh*** - script for testing packages of tests
